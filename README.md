# WunderGraph Next.js Starter

This example demonstrates how to use WunderGraph with Next.js & Postgres. We are going to make your database accessible through JSON-RPC to your Next.js app.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies and run the complete example in one command:

```shell
npm install && npm start
```

After a while, a new browser tab will and you can start exploring the application. If no tab is open, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
